# MyPersonalWebsite

Last summer, I got the opportunity to work for a start up as a frontend developer. Through that, I have learned to use React and Bootstraps as long as stepping up my CSS skills. With these tools, I have decided to code my own **Website Portfolio** to showcase my CS projects, organizations, and other hobbies that I am passionate about. This is the source code of my personal website 

## Technologies 

- Html, Javascript, CSS
- React 
- Bootstrap 

## Deployment 

I am thinking of deploying my project on github page but that is for me in the future to decide once I finish coding this page.
